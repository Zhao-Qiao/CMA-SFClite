This is a small placeholder corpus for perplexity evaluation.
It contains a few paragraphs of generic English text so that
language model likelihood can be measured in a stable way.

Large language models are typically evaluated on next-token
prediction tasks. Perplexity is the exponential of the average
negative log-likelihood, and lower values indicate better fit.

In this project we study bias–perplexity trade-offs. We compare
the remaining bias after local circuit edits with the change in
perplexity measured on a held-out text. The goal is to minimize
both remaining bias and performance cost, moving points closer
to the lower-left corner of the Pareto plane.

The text below is intentionally simple and neutral. You can replace
this file with a longer corpus (e.g., a WikiText-2 excerpt) for
more stable measurements.

The method applies small interventions to internal features and
connections. It then measures the effect on a fixed bias metric
and on language modeling performance. When the intervention is
more targeted, the reduction in bias can be achieved with a smaller
increase in perplexity. This suggests that local edits can be
preferable to coarse head ablations in practical settings.
